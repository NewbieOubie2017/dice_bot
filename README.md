# dice_bot  bettingGamebot.py A simple python3 program to see if you double your money or go bust with always betting on 7 and betting $50.00.


bettingGamebot2.py is a simple python3 program using the Gambling house rules (first roll wins with 7 or 11 and loses with 2, 3 or 12) and if you make your point before a 7 then you win or if 7 comes up before your point then you lose.  $50 bet plays until bust 0.00 bank or break the bank $1,000.00.
After posting the bettingGamebot2.py I wondered how high the bank had gone before going bust and how low the bank had gone before reaching $1,000.00 so I added that tracking.  Sure enough running a the program a few times I saw a winning result with the lowest being 500 one time and 50 being the lowest another.  Also one run went bust after getting as high as $950 and others where $500 was the highest bank before going bust.  "Know when to hold 'em and know when to fold 'em"
